# Team-Profile-Generator
Make a command line tool that takes user input for team members and creates html pages based on that info

The application must include Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must ALL pass.
The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and methods:

name

id

email

getName()

getId()

getEmail()

getRole()—returns 'Employee'

The other three classes will extend Employee.
In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Manager will also have the following:

officeNumber

getRole()—overridden to return 'Manager'

In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have the following:

github—GitHub username

getGithub()

getRole()—overridden to return 'Engineer'

In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Intern will also have the following:

school

getSchool()

getRole()—overridden to return 'Intern'

Finally, although it’s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.
