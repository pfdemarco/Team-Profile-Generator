// The application must include Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern classes. The tests for these classes (in the _tests_ directory) must ALL pass.
// The first class is an Employee parent class with the following properties and methods:


// name


// id


// email


// getName()


// getId()


// getEmail()


// getRole()—returns 'Employee'


// The other three classes will extend Employee.
// In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Manager will also have the following:


// officeNumber


// getRole()—overridden to return 'Manager'


// In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Engineer will also have the following:


// github—GitHub username


// getGithub()


// getRole()—overridden to return 'Engineer'


// In addition to Employee's properties and methods, Intern will also have the following:


// school


// getSchool()


// getRole()—overridden to return 'Intern'


// Finally, although it’s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.
